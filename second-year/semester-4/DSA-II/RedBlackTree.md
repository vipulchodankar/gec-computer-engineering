State the properties of red black trees and also illustrate
the LLB, LLR, LRR and LRB transformations in Red Black trees

1. Root of Red Black is black
2. Leaf nodes are black in color
3. Consecutive red nodes are not allowed
4. Color of child node and color of parent pointer to child node is same
5. New node inserted into RBTree is always red
6. Count of black nodes in any path of the node is always the same
7. Rank of a node = Count (black pointers on any path from node to child to external node)
