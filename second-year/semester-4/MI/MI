8086 Instruction Set

1. Data Transfer
    
    mov
    ppush - push a word onto stack
    pop - pop word from top of stack
    pusha - pushes all registers into stack
    popa - pop all registers from stack and push into registers
    xchg
    
    in - user input word stored in ax register
    out - ax register content will be outputted

    lea - load address of operands
    lds - load data segment
    les - load extra segment

    lahf - load lower byte of data from flag register into ah
    sahf - store data into lower byte of ah
    pushf - push flag onto stack 
    popf - pop stack top into flag

    aaa - ascii adjust after addition

    add - add two registers and store result in first
    adc - add with carry
    inc - increment
    jnge - jump not greater than equal to

    sub - subtract
    dec - decrement
    npg - takes complement and add two's complement to it

    cmp - compares two numbers | subs num2 from num1, if num2 > num1 then sign flag, if equal then ...

    mul - multiply a byte with byte/ word with word | unsigned, positive only
    imul - muls signed numbers 2 bytes or 2 words

    div - divides a double word(32b) with a word or with Bytes | 32/16 or 16/8
    idiv - div but with signed numbers

    cbw - copies sign of lower byte into upper byte
    cwd - cbw but with lower word and double word
    not - reverses 0s and 1s
    and - add 2 bits
    or - mul 2 bits
    xor - perform xor on each bit
    test - similar to add, sets flag but doesnt change operands
    
    shl/sal - shifts left/
    shr/sar - shifts right/ shift right but keep same msb
    
    rol - rotate left also carry flag
    ror - rotates right also carry flag
    rcr - rotates right with carry exchange moved out bit with carry bit
    rcl - "" left


2. Arithmatic
3. Bit Manipulation
4. String
5. Program Execution
6. Processor Control
7. Iteration Control
8. Interrupt
